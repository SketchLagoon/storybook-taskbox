## Taskbox
This is a step by step recreation of the Taskbox project found [here](https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/react/en/get-started/)

### User Story 
As an aspiring UX Designer / Full Stack Developer I needed to better test the components I design so that I can better serve any team that I work on. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn run storybook`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
